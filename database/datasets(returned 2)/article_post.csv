Aside from its obvious features, what makes Time stand out from competitors is that it's launching through a Kickstarter campaign. You may remember that back in 2012, Pebble got its start via one of the largest Kickstarter campaigns ever. So far, it's already raised more than $3.8 million dollars of its $500,000 goal, and the campaign just went up this morning. Wowza.So what features does Pebble Time offer? For one, a new interface that displays info like notifications, news, and weather chronologically through a timeline. ""Instead of having to open an app, everything is at-a-glance, helping you accomplish more throughout your day,"" Pebble said in a news release. Companies like the Weather Channel, Evernote, and Pandora have signed up to partner with Pebble for the OS. Then there's a color epaper display and a new microphone that lets you respond to notifications. It's also 20 percent thinner than the original Pebble. Plus, it's got the battery life that lasts up to seven days and the water resistance you're used to from other Pebbles.”",

At this moment, we’re witness to a defining moment for the smartwatch industry: In few weeks, Apple is set to release its first smartwatch. This, no doubt, creates pressure for a company like Pebble to prove that it can still drive demand.Pebble, however, appears prepared for this event. Days ago the company officially introduced support for Android Wear notifications, enabling compatible Android apps to communicate with Pebble devices. For a company that once favored iOS, Pebble knows its (arguably) most important market: Android users.Lucky for Pebble, Android Wear watches aren’t exactly flying off the shelves.”",

And often it doesn't work with the documents her professors provide. ""Sometimes I feel angry and frustrated,"" says Taylor, who plans to graduate from her program in May. ""My classmates can say, 'I did my homework in three hours,' and I think, 'Lucky you. I had to obtain this document and find it in a usable format and struggle harder because of the added time.'""Online education can seem like a promising alternative for students with physical and sensory disabilities, some of whom would struggle to navigate a physical campus. But even the most accessible online programs can still pose challenges for students like Taylor.Since not all online programs are equal when it comes to their resources for students with disabilities, experts suggest students do their research before choosing a program and prepare to advocate for themselves once enrolled.”",

He asks, “How many people think they got 80 percent?” Most nod noncommittally. But Kishchukova pipes up: “More.”“Ninety percent?” conductor C. Paul Heins asks.“More,” she says.“One hundred percent?”It’s hard to tell under the blazing stage lights, but the lanky 18-year-old, who goes by Liza, is grinning.Then that confidence fades. Heins asks the singers about a lyric in a Christina Aguilera song: “Every day is so wonderful. Then suddenly, it’s hard to breathe. Now and then, I get insecure from all the pain. I’m so ashamed.””",

And if you close your eyes, a river, a silent and beautiful current, fills you from within, flows forward, forward, darkens you: night brings its wetness to beaches in your soul.Since its reveal, it has been mastered into bespoke audio-visual installations in cities across the world, featuring in the iconic new Visitor Centre, Titanic Belfast later that month.  Following the celebrations around the opening of the new building and marking 100 years since the loss of Titanic, the projection of Virtual Choir 3, Water Night, in the atrium of Titanic Belfast provided a moment of contemplation for the lost souls.It also featured as an audio installation on London’s Milennium Bridge, as part of the celebrations for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, commissioned by the Mayor of London.”",

And they're going fast. It's slated to ship in May at a retail price of $200.The Pebble Time retains what made the original Pebble and Pebble Steel such well-liked products—simplicity of use, compatibility with a wide variety of devices, lots of apps via its open developer platform—and adds a color e-paper display, It's still not a touchscreen, so you navigate via button presses. E-paper isn't as vivid as LED, but it is much more viewable in bright light. The new watch is also thinner and lighter that prior models, and curved to better fit wrists.Perhaps the most striking addition is a feature called Timeline, which organizes information from your past, present, and future in chronological order on the watch. You can scroll back to catch up with stuff like old e-mail, sports scores, and your number of steps from the day before; scroll forward for the future, such as appointments, reminders, and weather reports. You determine which apps and developers can add ""pins"" to your timeline.Pebble promises to bring Timeline to the original Pebble and Pebble Steel, but hasn't yet said when this will happen.”",

It can be configured to work as either a messenger bag, backpack, or briefcase. It is constructed from a water-resistant fabric, with waterproof zippers and lots of padding to keep all that gear safe.While the Phorce may be great at charging your mobile devices, it will do a decent job of draining your wallet. The original Kickstarter campaign said the bags would retail for $349 and $449 for PC and Mac versions, respectively. But the bags, available in red and black, actually cost €549 (about $721) for the PC version and €599 (about $787) for the Mac version, which comes with a Magsafe cable for Macbooks. The bags can be ordered on the Phorce website.",
